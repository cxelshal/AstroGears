    <h1>Prototype Details</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our gauntlet prototype page. Here, we'll provide all the information about our design, sensors, code, and debugging process for the gauntlet.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Main Design Goals</h2>
    <p>Our team had several design goals for the gauntlet:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enhanced safety features to navigate through the earthquake-stricken building.</li>
      <li>Real-time monitoring of gas leaks, temperature, humidity, and distance to ensure the safety of the rescuer.</li>
      <li>Aesthetically pleasing design to boost the credibility of the rescuer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sensor Selection</h2>
    <p>We chose the following sensors for our mission:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gas Sensor (MQ-135): To detect dangerous gas leaks and provide early warnings.</li>
      <li>Temperature and Humidity Sensor (Adafruit AM2320): To monitor environmental conditions.</li>
      <li>Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (HC-SR04): To help navigate through dark rooms and obstacles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Code Design</h2>
    <p>Our Arduino code was carefully designed to achieve the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Read data from the sensors: temperature, humidity, gas level, and distance.</li>
      <li>Display real-time sensor data on the OLED screen.</li>
      <li>Control the buzzer to provide audio alerts based on distance readings.</li>
      <li>Adjust the RGB LED color based on the temperature reading.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The code follows a modular approach, with separate functions for sensor readings and distance measurement.</p>

    <h2>Problem Solving and Debugging</h2>
    <p>During the development process, we encountered various challenges:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Incorrect sensor readings: We used the engineering mindset to carefully check sensor connections and ensure proper wiring.</li>
      <li>Unexpected behavior: We utilized the Serial Monitor to print sensor readings and troubleshoot issues with the code logic.</li>
      <li>Iterative testing: We performed multiple iterations to improve the code and hardware based on real-world scenarios.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Iterative Design CAD</h2>
    <p>Our gauntlet underwent multiple 3D printing iterations:</p>
